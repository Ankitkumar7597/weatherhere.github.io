In my project, I have integrated the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides valuable weather data. Each user is required to obtain their own API key from OpenWeatherMap and input it into the application. This API key serves as a unique identifier and grants access to the weather information provided by OpenWeatherMap. By including this functionality, users can customize their experience and receive accurate and up-to-date weather data specific to their location.
